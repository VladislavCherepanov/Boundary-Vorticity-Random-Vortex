This repository contains two notebooks with code used in the paper "On the dynamics of the boundary vorticity for incompressible viscous flows". These use different methods for approximating the boundary vorticity -- one computes it using the derivative of the velocity (hence, using the derivative of the Biot--Savart kernel), in the other on it is computed using the dynamic equation (i.e. heat equation).
